## The new era of modular smartphone will come next year with the coming of Google Ara. Google said an Ara kit for developers will be available this fall. Who's excited?

A teaser video from the www.projectara.com shows people swapping the removable modules on their smartphone as they head to the beach, play music and sing songs. Actually the idea behind a phone made of removable modules is really intriguing but potentially disruptive, and at the same time fraught with challenges. It feels like Google want us to explore any Ara module into any of its (up to) half-dozen slot and it just works.

The Ara frame is built with durable latches and connectors to keep modules secured. Ara modules are designed around standards, allowing them to work with new generations of frames and new form factors. The plug-and-play modules, may include different type of cameras, microphone, speakers, projectors, extra batteries, music players, and even a breathalyzer or thermometer, you can eject and plug them easily only with an "OK Google" command. This is a new breakthrough for  consumer benefit is that by purchasing certain modules, you might be able to easily modernize your phone without having to replace the hardware as often as you currently might.**

But it turns out the technology is still in question. Dave Hakkens, creator of the Phonebloks thinks that concept Project Ara isn't the modular dream it's touted to be according to. On his blog, Hakkens explains where Ara falls down as a 'modular' phone. His main criticism is that it's not actually properly modular, at least not in the sense that he'd originally imagined.

"It basically means the Ara skeleton is a fully equipped phone with things like CPU, antennas, sensors, battery and display. The 6 little blocky modules on the back of the phone are just add-ons like better camera's, speakers, scanners etc. Things to customise your phone, for fun. It means your phone still gets obsolete after a while. What if your screen breaks? Well you still need to replace the entire phone. And after a couple of years it gets slow and you need to replace your entire skeleton," said Hakkens.

I really understand that this technology still has limitations to creating a good modular device. I hope that Google had cleared the hurdle and bring us something revolutionary. But maybe it won't be next year's Project Ara.
