# The Pros & Cons of Virtual Reality

![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ad2e985d-4f96-4f53-a412-ad1bdf2b823b.jpg)

The definition of virtual reality (VR) comes from the definitions for both virtual and reality. Virtual is near and reality is what we experience as human beings. So the term virtual reality basically means near-reality. So for simple, virtual reality usually refers to a specific type of reality emulation. Virtual reality is created for making the user feel the artificial environment as a real environment with the use of three dimensional images of life sizes. For this, user has to put on special goggles or gear which are used to track the position of the user and transfer the data to the computer.

But as you know, since childhood we are always advised not to look at the screen too close because it's not good for your eyes. And now with the presence of virtual reality it's like you put the screen right in front of the eye. Is it good for your eyes? I don't think so. Most people believe that virtual reality will become way of the future, but many of them strongly oppose its integration into society. Let me describe the pros and cons first, after that you can decide yourself whether want to agree or not.

## 

PROS

1. VR redefines the idea of communication, expanding it from people you know in real life to anyone connected to the internet. This means that relationships will begin to be formed more based off interests than general location.
2. Many different field can use VR to train people in a way that would usually put them at risk. This is used most notably in the fields of medicine, law enforcement, architecture and aviation.
3. Those who are not able to fully experience reality, such as disabled people, could explore the virtual world and still experience a full life.
4. VR makes tourism and visiting sites more easy by giving a detailed view of the original place, for example; 360 virtual tour.
5. VR provides a chance to experience things that are impossible in real life as if you were actually there, for example; fighting zombies in a game.

## CONS

****

1. Those who do not have access or cannot afford this technology will be left out. Could further separate social classes in information age based societies.
2. Communication using this technology would be susceptible to deception.
3. Due to the fast paced development of virtual reality and online worlds, there is a lack of laws regarding these worlds. Users can say and do things in these worlds that is illegal in reality. Also, users may be less inhibited than in real life due to a sense of anonymity, and may act in a way that is socially unacceptable.
