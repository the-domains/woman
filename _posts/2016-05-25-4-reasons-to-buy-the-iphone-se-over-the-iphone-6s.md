Having launched the latest series of iPhone SE, a lot of people would have questioned Apple's decision that seemed to kill its own products. Why? Because roughly iPhone SE is the iPhone 6S in the form of the iPhone 5S. For those of you who still do not understand, I will reveal more details, 4 reasons to buy an iPhone than the iPhone 6S SE.

* **No need to pay too expensive just for an iPhone**

The most annoying thing when you buy the latest iPhone product is the price is too expensive. Even for 12 month installment you still have to spend more than a million rupiah for the iPhone 6S 128GB per month. It was a relatively large amount of money. But for iPhone SE, though it is not cheap but the starting price is pretty good comparison. Although in Indonesia, the price is still unknown but predicted price range will fall in eight millions rupiah. And this is still decent for a smartphone in this class.

* **Get the latest and greatest hardware**

As already mentioned earlier, technically iPhone SE has a common with the iPhone 6S. In terms of data processing, image quality with main camera 12MP and 4K video, not to mention a 64 -bit Apple A9 chipset also 2GB RAM. Some elements in the iPhone SE is not even owned by the iPhone 6S, so it is not possible if it will even surpass 6S SE, isn't it?

* **Long-lasting battery**

Although not tried directly iPhone SE, but it's been a lot of reviews saying that the durability of the batteries much longer than the iPhone 6S. Definitely this will be a fresh breeze for you the IOS users who often struggle with subpar battery life.

* **Smaller phone**

****

It doesn't matter whether you have small, medium, or large-sized hands: sometimes all you need is able to reach each end of the smartphone without any constraints. Although iPhone SE is not a redesign of 5S, but have a similar device from design standpoint. This smartphone will be more comfortable and easy to put in a pocket.**\[EFB/image: doc. Apple\]**
