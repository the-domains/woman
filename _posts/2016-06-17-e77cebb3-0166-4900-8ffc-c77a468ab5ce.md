# Apple's Youngest App Developer is Still Nine

****

Let's meet Anvitha Vijay, age 9, from Melbourne, Australia. She's the star at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference 2016 (WWDC) that takes place from June 13 to 17 in San Francisco. Anvitha created an iPhone/iPad app about animals, Smartkins Animals, an applied to be selected for one of the coveted scholarships to attend Apple's annual developer conference.

For her pleasure, Apple said yes, and now she's signing autographs, posing for selfies with grown-up app developers and hanging around with Apple CEO, Tim Cook. Cook himself gave Vijay a shout-out during his Monday keynote as the youngest developer ever to attend Apple's WWDC, one of 350 mostly high school and college students invited by Apple to attend the conference for free. At WWDC, scholarship winners get to attend coding and programming sessions, and mix and mingle with app developers, to learn from veterans.

On interview with USA Today, Anvhita said that she started coding at age 7 by watching YouTube instructional videos, and was motivated to make an app to teach her younger sister how to identify the names of animals. She used Xcode, an Apple program for creating mobile apps, and has seen a "few hundred" downloads. She also still working on her new app called, GoalsHi, to give students more confidence in classroom. She used Apple's more advanced Swift programming language to work on the new app and is eager to try Swift Playgrounds, a new, easier version of the software Apple introduced at WWDC for kids, on the iPad.
