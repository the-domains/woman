# 5 Best Smartwatches Right Now

Smartphones have become an essential part of our lives, but sometimes they get in the way of, well... living. Smartwatches were conceived as a band-aid for this problem---a way to keep us from parking big glowing rectangles in front of our faces on a permanent basis.

So far, it's hard to say whether they're doing any good, but at their best they can help us manage our ever-expanding digital lives. They can also act as surprisingly fashionable accessories, and it's this marriage of utility and style that has brands as diverse as Apple and Fossil falling all over themselves to get into the market.

This is my own choice of best smartwatches for mid year 2016\. Check this out, peeps!

## 

## Huawei Watch

It might surprise you, but in my opinion the best Android Wear watch comes from a Chinese company with virtually no brand recognition in the U.S. Considered by many to be the Apple of China, Huawei initially made waves with affordable smartphones that offer the kind of style and polish we commonly associate with the iPhone maker.

Huawei Watch bears all the same hallmarks, with a truly circular display, responsive software, decent battery life, and a heart rate sensor packed into a compact, stylish body. That's a feat other Android watch makers have struggled to reproduce.

## 

## Apple Watch

Actually, only the Apple Watch gives iPhone all the features they'd expect of a smartwatch. Regardless, the Apple Watch provides a respectable user experience for those already in the fold. The apps are generally more robust than those designed for Android Wear and there are way more of them. For example, Apple Watch users get access to official Instagram and Twitter apps, while Android Wear users only get notifications.

Still, there are three big problems with the Watch: the user interface, app performance, and battery life. Unfortunately, watchOS isn't super intuitive, creating a learning curve that could frustrate less tech-savvy buyers. Apps still take too long to load, even with the upgraded watchOS 2.0\. And the battery only lasts about a day and a half at best. That's about average for a smartwatch, but far from the class-leading usability we expect from Apple.

But if you own an iPhone and want the true smartwatch experience, the Apple Watch is the best choice for you. There's simply no alternative.

## 

## Asus ZenWatch 2

While the Huawei Watch is my top Android pick, the Asus ZenWatch 2 came in a close second. The hardware is just as speedy, and the battery life is just as decent. The ZenWatch 2 also offers a large, square display that feels bigger than most rivals, yet it never feels bulky.

The only thing this watch is missing is a heart rate sensor, but unless you're a fitness fanatic, you'll probably get by without it just fine. Considering you can find it for half the price of the Huawei, it's definitely a compelling alternative.

## 

## LG Watch Urbane

The LG Watch Urbane is a good all-around smartwatch. It offers decent battery life, performance, and build, and that's why it's smack dab in the middle of this list. It doesn't really do anything a whole lot better or worse than the competition---it's just decent.

While the Urbane is marketed on its high-end styling, the watch face is oddly long, making it look bulky on all but the biggest wrists. And considering LG just released a second-gen version with a built-in cellular radio, you might want to opt for the newer model---or a different watch altogether.

## 

## Moto 360 (2nd gen.)

As Android Wear watches go, the second-generation Moto 360 does most things well. There are a couple annoying issues, though: its battery life doesn't quite stack up to the competition, and it's bulkier than we'd like.

It'll still get you through the day without driving you crazy, but you can definitely get a better watch for your money. However, if Moto's design tickles your fancy, you won't have a bad experience with this watch.
