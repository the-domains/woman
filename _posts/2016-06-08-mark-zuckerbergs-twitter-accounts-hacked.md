Having your social media been hacked before? It turns out that the owner of Facebook and Instagram got through it last Sunday. One of popular Facebook "security tip" for users is, "Don't use your Facebook password anywhere else online." If only Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg take that advice. He reused 'dadada' as password in his social media accounts. 

A team of hackers called OurMine is claiming credit for the hack. The Facebook CEO's accounts on Twitter and Pinterest were compromised by hackers, according to screenshots of the pages published by tech website Engadget. Zuckerberg has regained access to both accounts, and any messages posted have been removed.

Actually the consequences of his account takeovers weren't severe. And the hacker who took over his Twitter account just want to embarrass Zuckerberg with posting his highly insecure "dadada" password to the site. Even though he is not a power Twitter user: He has tweeted only 19 times, most recently in 2012\. So in my opinion this is just an act of attention seeker, who will think that the CEO of Facebook and Instagram hacked, right?

Hacks like the incident involving Zuckerberg are a reminder to use stronger passwords or enable features including two-factor authentication to secure accounts. Security experts suggest creating different passwords for each online account you use. Web users can also use password manager apps that will create different, random passwords for multiple sites.
