  There's a reason why "no" is one of first words we learn to say. Life never
  fails to throw us offers and opportunities that are worth turning down. As we
  grow up, it's no longer the suggestion that we finish our broccoli that we're
  most hard-pressed to reject-it's the requests to do more work and the dubious
  job offers that we have to find ways of declining politely.
