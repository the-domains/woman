# 6 Best Artificial Intelligence Application as Your Personal Assistant

Dreaming of your own Jarvis (A.I. assistant that created by Tony Stark)? Although not as perfect, but the technology that you think only exist in Marvel movie now already developed. You can try out some apps today that demonstrate origin forms of the technology by smartly, swiftly and automatically doing tasks that would otherwise take lots of effort.

The Roll

The reason behind The Roll is quite simple: without any input from you, it will automatically organize, tag, and rate all of the photos on your iPhone. Once you open the app and give it permission to access your photos, The Roll gets to work. Each photo is given an aesthetic score between 0 and 100, multiple nearly-identical shots are bunched together with the best one on top, and tags are automatically added to your images so you can actually find them later without scrolling to infinity. It will organize your images by topic, location, and event, add tags to all of your images, and give each image a score. It will automatically analyzes and rates your images, pulling out the best ones for your consideration.

EasilyDo

If you've never used a smart assistant before, EasilyDo will simply blow your mind away. EasilyDo takes over a variety of your everyday activities. There are about 40 actions that it can take care of and these span across location-based actions, facebook-based actions, email-based, calendar events, contacts, reminders. Instead of incorporating full-blown calendar features of its own, it connects to the calendar you've already got, so it can do things such as plug in appointments based on invitations it finds in your e-mail. Even if a meeting just gets mentioned in a message rather than sent as a formal calendar invite, EasilyDo can often identify it and ask if you'd like to schedule it. Not only that, you also can tell it to send a text message when you leave a particular location after a specified hour. It can also scan your inbox for emails about bills and then remind you to pay them.

24Me

Is a personal digital assistant that, much like EasilyDo, connects to different online accounts and manages your affairs. It combines several convenient features to automate much of your life---including paying bills and running errands. You could also add a task like "Call A" and 24me will add the call button next to the task. Besides all that, this free app is also a full task manager where you can also add tasks by voice or by taking a photo, set reminders and notes, drag-and-drop to sort tasks, and share tasks with others.

Google Now

The app mainly sits in the background, but often surprises you with an alert that is really useful --- for example, a warning of traffic on the way to your next meeting or inform you about match schedule of your favorite football team. Google Now can also help find nearby attractions and manage restaurant reservations, and you can speak to it in natural language to do searches just saying "Ok, Google". But to activate Google Now in iOs will involves extra step, so I will recommend you to use next app.

Siri

One of the best-known AI apps is Apple's Siri. It powered by some very interesting technology, which tries to understand not just your words but your sentences. Understanding meaning is a lot trickier than just identifying words. You can use Siri daily to begin phone calls, send text messages and set timers, reminders and alarms. The app can now answer sophisticated questions about science, or help with navigation. Now that Siri is instantly accessible on the latest iPhones by speaking "Hey Siri," and make it even more useful.

Cortana

Cortana only work for Windows 10 smartphone, but also available on desktop version of Windows 10\. Cortana is taking over as the Search part of Windows 10\. It's not just a speech assistant, but rather both a Siri-like voice assistant and an intelligent text analyser -- so you can type, not just talk, to Cortana. You can long-press the search button to make Cortana start listening, or a quick tap to type. Cortana feels like unification of Google Now and Siri. Why? You can tool Cortana up with information about your interests and life -- such as your point interests, hours when you don't want to be disturbed, and so on. It also learns more about you based on your Bing search history or you can just talk to it.
